# About me

I'm a self-taught Pythonista, Rustacean and open-source contributor, with a particular interest in Python-typing. My day job is currently writing devtools in Rust for the Python ecosystem at Astral.

In my spare time, I'm a CPython core dev. I also maintain typeshed, typing_extensions and flake8-pyi.
